## Concrete mix design optimization using ML
- Predicted the compressive strength of concrete using an extensive dataset of 8 independent variables.
- Experimented the dataset with Linear regression, Lasso regression and Ridge regression.
- Compared the RMSE, MSE and R2 values of the results of the three models.
- Technologies Used: Keras, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebooks.
